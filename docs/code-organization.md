# How the code is structured

```
src/
  main/  <- application source code
    java/
      edu/mills/contactlist  <- the java package for this app
                   impl/     <- where your implementation code will go
                   io/       <- routines for reading and writing files
  test/  <- unit tests
    java/
      edu/mills/contactlist  <- mirrors the directory and file structure
                                of src/main/java
